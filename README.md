I analyzed the Skill2vec dataset available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09751, comprising skill data extracted from 50,000 job descriptions. 
This task was carried out in Databricks and was part of my Big Data Analytics coursework at the University of Sheffield. My objective was to identify patterns within the dataset.
